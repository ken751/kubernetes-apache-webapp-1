# Kubernetes Project Updated
In this project we are going to Dockerize our apache application.
We will then push the Docker image to our DockerHub account
We are going to Deploy an EKS cluster called playground-cluster with three nodes in us-east-2. 
Then we will create a Deployment for our apache application with two replica of our pod.
We will finally create a Load balancer service to expose our apache application on port 80.
